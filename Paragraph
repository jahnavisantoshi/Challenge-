The HTML code for embedding an image on a webpage utilizes the <img> tag, which is a self-closing or empty tag, meaning it does not require a separate closing tag. This tag primarily relies on attributes to define the image's characteristics and source. The essential attribute is src, which specifies the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or file path of the image to be displayed. Another crucial attribute is alt, providing alternative text that describes the image, serving accessibility purposes for screen readers and appearing if the image fails to load. Optional attributes like width and height can be used to define the image's dimensions, although it is often recommended to control image sizing through CSS for better responsiveness and separation of concerns.
